# Hurricane Analysis Toolkit

## Overview
This repository provides a set of tools for analyzing hurricane data, including functions for coordinate conversion, wind speed analysis, and visualization.

## Features
- Convert Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates
- Interpolate wind speed data across pressure levels
- Calculate Radius of Maximum Winds (RMW)
- Visualize hurricane data with customizable coastline plots

## Sample Data
- Sample ERA-5 data is available at https://www.nsstc.uah.edu/data/ankur.kumar/ERA_IDA/2021-08-28-atmospheric.nc

## Sample Code
- Sample code to calculate RMW from ERA-5 data is available in the Jupyter notebook `calculate_ERA_RMW.ipynb`
